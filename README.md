A few weeks ago I was at my childhood home and I noticed some decorative blocks that read "Give Thanks" on a shelf and I started to try to think of ways I could re-arrange them to spell something funny, but I wanted to still use most of the blocks which made things difficult.

So I went online to find a scrabble solver that I can use to do the hard work for me. When I was typing the letters into the website I realized it had a 10 letter limit. If I were to only use the letters this would have been fine, but I wanted to use the extra blocks with images as more letters to broaden the range of words available. This adds an 11th letter 'L' using the leaf block, meaning we can no longer use the online scrabble website. The only reasonable solution at this point is obviously to make my own with no letter limit.

After writing the code, I rearranged my poor moms decoration to spell a new word. Having similarity to crossword had me and a brother of mine thinking though. It would theoretically be pretty simple to change the code to make words that intersect as well. This is exactly what I did.

The other files in this repo are just other similar projects that also use the giant word list that I have found and cumulated.
